const markQuizPhase3Part2 = `No, Grandma, please! I really need the money sent directly to my debit card. If you buy a ticket online, it will go to this stranger's phone, and I won't be able to get it. I just need the cash quickly to sort this out myself. This is the only way! Please help me!`;

I don't know anyone here, I don't have enough money to get home, and I can't ask my parents without things getting even worse. You're the only person I can rely on right now-I'm really scared about what's going to happen if I'm left out here alone. Please, I need your help!`;
