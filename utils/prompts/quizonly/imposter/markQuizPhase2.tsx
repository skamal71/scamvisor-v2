I got myself stuck in Boston and I can't figure out how to get home. I really need your help, but I can't risk calling anyone, especially my parents. If they find out I'm here, I'll be in so much trouble-worse than you can imagine. Please keep this just between us.`;

I’d break their trust right before college, and they might never forgive me. I’m begging you, I really need your help and only yours right now. Please keep this just between us.`;

It was a dumb move, and now I see how badly I screwed up. I'm trying to figure out how to get home, but the tickets are really expensive, and I don't have enough saved. I'm honestly panicking, Grandma. Please help me!`;
